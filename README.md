# BookBot

BookBot generates a report for a text file, counting the number of words and occurrences of each alphabetic character. The report is then printed to the console.

## Usage

To use BookBot, run the script and provide the path to the text file you want to analyze as a command-line argument.

For example, [frankenstein.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt) could be used.

```
python main.py books/frankenstein.txt
```
