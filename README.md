# BookBot

BookBot generates a report for the ["frankenstein.txt"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt) file located in the "books" directory, counting the number of words and occurrences of each alphabetic character. The report is then printed to the console.
